# TSP_CPLEX_2
 This repository contains sample code for TSP using Python/CPLEX

## Problem Definition
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) consists of a salesman and a set of cities. The salesman has to
visit each one of the cities starting from a certain one (e.g. the hometown) and returning to the
same city. The challenge of the problem ius that the traveling salesman wants to minimize the total
length of the trip.

## Mathematical Formulation
The mathematical formulation is an adaptation of the more general multiple TSP (mTSP) found in the following paper
by Masoumeh Vali and Khodakaram Salimifard:

A Constraint Programming Approach for Solving
Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem: https://ozgurakgun.github.io/ModRef2017/files/ModRef2017_MTSP.pdf 

## Main Files
* `data_arc.csv` = input file for model, distances between cities 
* `TSP.py` = Python model for TSP problem
* `TSP.ipynb` = Jupyter notebook with additional same python model as in TSP.py but with additional notes and images

## Helper Files
* `util.py` = contains helper function used in the `TSP.py` file
* `img_9.3-1_network.png` = image used in Jupyter notebook
* `img_9.3-1_table.png` = image used in Jupyter notebook 

#### Additional notes
* An `output` folder is created when a model script is run. It stores exported csv solutions  

## Instructions
The TSP models in this repository require CPLEX to solve. If you are unable to install CPLEX, you can see a sample of 
the code output in the Jupyter notebook view of this repository or through nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shellei503/TSP_CPLEX_2/blob/master/TSP.ipynb

1. Open TSP.py
2. Update user defined parameters if needed (or leave default values)

* `input_file_name = 'data_arc.csv'`
* `model_name = 'TSP'`
* `output_file_name1 = model_name+'_arc'`
* `output_file_name2 = model_name+'_city'`

3. Run the model using default configurations
4. Review model results in the newly created `output` folder -> `TSP/output`

## Required Environment/Packages/Libraries
* Conda
* Python             (3.7)
* cplex              (12.10.0.1)
* docplex            (2.13.184)

## CPLEX Installation
You must already have CPLEX installed on your machine in order for the following pip install commands to work correctly.  
```
python -m pip install cplex
```
Some models are written using docplex module. Install `docplex` with `pip`
```
python -m pip install docplex
```
